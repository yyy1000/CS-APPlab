record and some thoughts.

1.Datalab (without float section)
  thoughts:
  1. !! is not equal with no !, and operator! can for excluding, eg: isTmax
  2. although we can't use || and &&, cause the return value is almost 0 or 1,
     so, we can use | and & instead, without Short-circuit evaluation.
  3. we must consider all the conditions: such as overflow or underflow
     also, 32bit int: 0x80000000 has no absolute value (~0x80000000)+1=0x80000000
